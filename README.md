Machine Learning Task 02 – Support Ticket Classification & Prioritization
Internship Program: Future Interns
Year: 2026

🔍 About the Task
In real-world companies, customer support teams receive hundreds or even thousands of support tickets daily in the form of emails, feedback forms, complaints, and issue reports.

Major challenges faced by support teams include:

Tickets not being categorized correctly
Urgent issues getting delayed 
Excessive manual effort spent on sorting tickets
This task focuses on solving these problems using Machine Learning, by automatically classifying and prioritizing customer support tickets.

Instead of building a chatbot, this task simulates a real business ML system used in SaaS companies, service platforms, and IT support teams.

🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to build a Machine Learning system that can:

Read customer support ticket text
Automatically classify tickets into categories such as:
Billing
Technical Issue
Account
General Query
Assign a priority level:
High
Medium
Low
This helps businesses respond faster, reduce ticket backlog, and improve customer satisfaction.

✅ What Was Done
As part of this task, the following steps were completed:

Loaded and explored text-based support ticket data
Cleaned and preprocessed raw text
Performed tokenization and text normalization
Converted text into numerical features using vectorization techniques
Trained machine learning classification models
Evaluated model performance using suitable metrics
Explained how the system improves support operations
This task goes beyond model training and focuses on building a decision-support system for real businesses.
