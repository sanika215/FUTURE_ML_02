# Machine Learning Task 02 – Support Ticket Classification & Prioritization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning system that automatically classifies and prioritizes customer support tickets using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

In real-world companies, support teams receive a large number of tickets daily. Manual sorting of tickets is time-consuming and can delay urgent issues. This system helps automate the process and improve efficiency.

## Objective
- Classify support tickets into categories such as:
  - Billing
  - Technical Issue
  - Account
  - General Query
- Assign priority levels:
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low
- Reduce manual workload and response time

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Text cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Tokenization and stopword removal  
4. Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Bag of Words  
5. Model training using classification algorithms  
6. Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics  

## Output
- Tickets are automatically categorized  
- Priority levels are assigned  
- Model performance is evaluated  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP can be applied to automate support ticket management.  
By classifying and prioritizing tickets automatically, organizations can respond faster, reduce backlog, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
